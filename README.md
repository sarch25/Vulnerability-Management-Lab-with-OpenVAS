# Vulnerability Management Lab with OpenVAS 

## Objective

In this project, I oversaw the establishment of a vulnerability management lab on Microsoft Azure that uses OpenVAS to provide a thorough investigation of vulnerability management techniques. I started by configuring the environment by allocating resources on Azure and launching a virtual machine that was already equipped with OpenVAS. In parallel, I created a client virtual machine (VM) that was intentionally left vulnerable in order to mimic real-world situations. OpenVAS was then configured for scanning, and in order to thoroughly evaluate system security, both credentialed and uncredentialed scans were performed. Vulnerabilities were found by analysis of scan data, which prompted corrective measures including removing out-of-date software. Successful mitigation was validated by verification of remediation activities, highlighting the significance of ongoing documentation and improvement throughout the project.

### Skills Learned

- Practical implementation of vulnerability management practices, including scanning, assessment, and remediation
- Configuration and utilization of OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning and analysis
- Importance of deliberate vulnerability exposure for realistic assessment and simulation of real-world scenarios
- Verification and validation of remediation efforts to ensure effective mitigation of vulnerabilities
- Emphasis on continuous improvement and documentation for ongoing enhancement of vulnerability management processes.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure: Cloud platform for provisioning resources
- Virtual Machine: Pre-configured with OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning
- OpenVAS: Open Vulnerability Assessment System for conducting scans and analyzing results
- Vulnerable Client VM: Created intentionally vulnerable to simulate real-world scenarios
- SSH Access: Established for configuring the VM and executing vulnerability scans
